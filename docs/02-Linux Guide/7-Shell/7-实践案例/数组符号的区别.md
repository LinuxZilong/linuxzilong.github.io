* 和 @ 的区别
```
These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the IFS variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a separate word.
$*，保存了以$IFS 指定的分割符所分割的字符串组。
$@，原样保存了参数列表，也就是"$1""$2"...
